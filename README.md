# Social Media_MySQL_Project 

<h2>1. Data Dive (10 pts):</h2>

So I decided to choose the Social Media Users Dataset to work on in my project. I did not encounter any challenges when importing the CSV file into MySQL Workbench.
The interesting thing about this dataset is that it has a lot of rows/data compared to what we have been using in class. I also noticed, compared to the Netfix Dataset, there are no empty/null values. This makes working with this dataset relatively easier.<br>



<h2>2. Data Fun (20 pts):</h2>

Use simple SQL queries to play with the data.<br>
Find 2 cool facts hidden within the data (e.g., most popular interests).<br>
Use basic SQL queries like (COUNT, AVG, and SUM) to understand more about the data you have.

<h2>3. Ask Away (30 pts):</h2>

Formulate 2 questions about the data (e.g., what are popular shows in different countries?).<br>
Write basic SQL queries (WHERE, ORDER BY) to find answers.<br>
Share what you learned from the answers.
