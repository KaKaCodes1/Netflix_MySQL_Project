# Social Media_MySQL_Project 

<h2>1. Data Dive (10 pts):</h2>

So I decided to choose the Social Media Users Dataset to work on in my project. I did not encounter any challenges when importing the CSV file into MySQL Workbench. I did notice though, that some of the rows have empty fields and I think it will be interesting to work with that.<br>
